            <p>Hi Baby</p>
            <p>Happy first!! Meeting you was truly unexpected but it was also truly a blessing.
                Life has been so much better since I met you, and is still getting better with you.
                I hope you know how grateful I am to have you in my life and I would do what I can to have you in my life and grow with you in this relationship.
                
            </p>
